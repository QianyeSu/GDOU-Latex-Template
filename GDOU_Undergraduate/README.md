# GDOU LaTeX Thesis Template Notes

You can use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to edit `.tex` and other related files for this thesis template.

VSCode is highly recommended for LaTeX projects because it offers:
- Syntax highlighting for LaTeX code
- Powerful extensions like LaTeX Workshop for compiling, previewing, and managing references
- Integrated PDF viewer and error checking
- Easy navigation and editing of multiple files

To get started:
1. Open the `GDOU` folder in VSCode.
2. Install the "LaTeX Workshop" extension from the VSCode Extensions marketplace.
3. Open and edit `Thesis.tex` or any file in the `Tex/` directory.
4. Use the extension commands to build and preview your PDF output.
